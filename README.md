This is the 2nd project in Udacity's [Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001) program.

In this project I used JavaScript, JQuery, HTML, and CSS to build an interactive resume. 

Test Version is to modify the resume with bootstrap...

The resume is hosted on github and can be viewed [here](http://pajamaprogrammer.github.io/FEND-Resume/).
